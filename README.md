For Linux machine enter command wget and paste the url to download the file.<br>

To get the URL right click on generic java package and click on copy link address.<br>

(wget http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war)<br>

wget  https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.277.2/jenkins.war<br>

11) Start the Jenkins.war file<br>

java -jar jenkins.war<br>
